The primary timeline begins with Ellen Parsons\u0027 recruitment by Patty Hewes to \u0022Hewes \u0026 Associates\u0022 and follows proceedings of a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher by his former employees, whom Patty represents. The initial episodes follow Patty\u0027s attempts to capture potential witness Gregory Malina through Katie Connor. The arc further details Malina\u0027s involvement with Frobisher\u0027s lawyer Ray Fiske and the pressure Patty brings to bear on Fiske on Malina\u0027s subsequent death.\n\nThe narrative includes multiple flashforwards of the alternative timeline, set approximately six months after Ellen\u0027s appointment, until both timelines converge in the penultimate episode of the season. The alternative timeline details the attack on Ellen, her arrest for the murder of her fianc\u00E9 David Connor, and the subsequent murder investigation.",

Ellen is unaware that Patty is suspicious of her, and that Frobisher\u0027s criminal connections appear to extend to her new friend Wes.\n\nA second timeline takes place six months later, when Ellen meets with an unknown person in a hotel room, and subsequently appears to shoot them.",
