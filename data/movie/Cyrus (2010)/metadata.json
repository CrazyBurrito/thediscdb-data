Still single seven years after the breakup of his marriage, John has all but given up on romance. But at the urging of his ex-wife and best friend Jamie, John grudgingly agrees to join her and her fianc\u00E9 Tim at a party. To his and everyone else\u0027s surprise, he actually manages to meet someone: the gorgeous and spirited Molly. Their chemistry is immediate. The relationship takes off quickly but Molly is oddly reluctant to take the relationship beyond John\u0027s house. Perplexed, he follows her home and discovers the other man in Molly\u0027s life: her son, Cyrus. A 21-year-old new age musician, Cyrus is his mom\u0027s best friend and shares an unconventional relationship with her.
