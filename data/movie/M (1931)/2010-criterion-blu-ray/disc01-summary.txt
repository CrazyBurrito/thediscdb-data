Description: Directory William Friedkin sat with Fritz Lang over the course of two days in 1975 (the year before Lang died) to make this remarkable film, which combines artful photography with intimate conversation. It should be noted that Lang was not a reliably truthful interview subject. Indeed, much doubt has been cast on the tale of his leaving Germany in 1933, which he recounts with great enthusiasm here. Even if the story isn't true, surely the astounding level of detail offered by Lang in its telling reveals a great cinematic mind at work.

Description: In the early sound era, many films were shot in multiple versions for different countries, and it was not uncommon for a completely new cast to reshoot a film in their native language. M, however, was a more hybrid affair, with a mix of dubbing and reshoots, resulting in French- and English-language versions, in addition to the German original. The French M was found in the 1990s, but the English version proved elusive. Thanks to the persistence of German film scholars Robert Fischer and Hans-Michael Bock, a print was finally located in the BFI archives in 2005. Though Fritz Lang probably did not participate in the filmin of this version, Peter Lorre does star in it. Thus his famous monologue at the end of the film must now be considered in English-language debut.

Description: For the television program Cine parade, Claude Chabrol was asked to inaugurate a series of homages to classic cinema by contemporary directors. Chabrol-himself often a director of tense psychosexual thrillers, such as Le boucher and La ceremonie-chose the ur-thriller M. In this short, a sort of M in ten minutes, Maurice Risch plays Peter Lorre playing Hans Beckert. The piece originally aired in 1982.
