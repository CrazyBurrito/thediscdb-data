  "Plot": "The Godfather \u0022Don\u0022 Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter\u0027s wedding. Michael, Vito\u0027s youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don\u0027s influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito\u0027s fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.",
