  "Plot": "The residents of Blaine, Missouri - the self-proclaimed home of the first UFO landing in the United States (Blaine residents beg to differ with Roswell\u0027s claims) and stool capital of the world - are excited about the town\u0027s upcoming sesquicentennial celebrations, which will have as its centerpiece the original musical production, \u0022Red, White and Blaine\u0022. Assisted by high school music teacher Lloyd Miller, Corky St. Clair, the musical\u0027s writer/composer and former New York theater professional (off off off off Broadway) who currently leads the Blaine Community Players, will helm the production. Corky and Lloyd are excited about their \u0027talented\u0027 cast of locals and the production as a whole, Corky and Lloyd who themselves are as untalented and unaware as their cast. Corky and company are especially anticipating the presence of Mort Guffman in the audience on opening night, he a representative of the prestigious New York based Oppenheimer Organization. In Corky\u0027s mind, a favorable review from Guffman means that the production is heading to Broadway. Through all the ups and downs and more downs of the pre-production, everyone in Blaine still can\u0027t wait for opening night and the arrival of Guffman, upon who the cast and crew\u0027s dreams rest.",
