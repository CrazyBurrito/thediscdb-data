  "Plot": "George Newman is a daydreamer whose hyperactive imagination keeps him from holding a steady job. His uncle decides George would be the perfect man to manage Channel 62, a television station which is losing money and viewers fast. When George replaces the station\u0027s reruns with bizarre programs such as \u0022Stanley Spadowski\u0027s Clubhouse\u0022, \u0022Wheel of Fish\u0022 and \u0022Raul\u0027s Wild Kingdom\u0022, ratings begin to soar again. Mean-spirited and cynical mogul R.J. Fletcher becomes furious that the UHF station is getting better ratings than his network\u0027s programming. Because of gambling debts, the uncle is forced to consider selling the station to Fletcher, who would only too happily shut it down (he cannot legally own two stations in the same town). George and his friends organize a 48-hour telethon to raise the money by selling investment stock from Channel 62 to save the town\u0027s new favorite station.",
