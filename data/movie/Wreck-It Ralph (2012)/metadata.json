But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun, Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan -- win a medal -- but soon wrecks everything, and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph\u0027s only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz, a young troublemaking \u0022glitch\u0022 from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy.
