  "Plot": "Squelching across a God-forsaken ghost town near the US/Mexican border, always dragging a heavy coffin, blue-eyed Django, a drifting, mud-spattered, former Union soldier, saves runaway Mar\u00EDa from certain death. But, the wooden container with the mysterious content has already caught the attention of the racist ex-Confederate officer, Major Jackson, and his gang of white supremacists, and before long, things get nasty. Now, the guns have the final say, and as if that weren\u0027t enough, Jackson\u0027s sworn enemy, General Hugo Rodr\u00EDguez, and his feared revolutionaries, enter the picture, wanting to have a piece of the action. Can Django, the taciturn stranger with the lighting-fast right hand, take on two armies of murderous henchmen, and live to tell the tale?",
  "Tagline": "He was pitiless in revenge, quick to decide, and a master of every weapon... a man everybody would liked to have seen dead!",
