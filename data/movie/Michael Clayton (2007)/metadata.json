Flash back four days. He owes a loan shark to cover his brother\u0027s debts (Michael\u0027s own gambling habits have left him virtually broke). His law firm is negotiating a high-stakes merger, and his firm\u0027s six year defense of a conglomerate\u0027s pesticide use is at risk when one of the firm\u0027s top litigators goes off his meds and puts the case in jeopardy. While Michael is trying to fix things someone decides to kill him. Who? Meanwhile his son summarizes the plot of a dark fantasy novel.",
