  "Plot": "Manhattan, Upper West Side, 1957. Against the backdrop of the decaying tenements in the San Juan Hill neighbourhood and the constant threat of the wrecking ball, two warring gangs--tough Riff\u0027s Jets and swaggering Bernardo\u0027s Puerto Rican Sharks--fight for supremacy. Now, with a once-and-for-all, winner-takes-all rumble on the cards, an unexpected whirlwind romance at the high-school dance between former Jet brawler Tony and Bernardo\u0027s delicate little sister Mar\u00EDa sets the stage for an all-out turf war. But what\u0027s a gang without its territory? Above all, when the future is uncertain, what\u0027s hope without love?",
