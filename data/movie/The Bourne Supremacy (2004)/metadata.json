Bourne and Marie have maintained their anonymous, underground existence at the cost of permanence. Fueled by splintered nightmares and haunted by the past he cannot remember, Bourne moves Marie from city to city, trying to remain one step ahead of the threat implicit in every unexplained stranger\u0027s glance, every \u0022wrong number\u0022 phone call--that at any second, without any warning, he might get pulled back into the world he hopes he left behind.",
