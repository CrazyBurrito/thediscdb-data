One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard and a sea goddess, Ponyo uses her father\u0027s magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke, but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo\u0027s father sends the ocean\u0027s mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo\u0027s dreams of becoming human.",
