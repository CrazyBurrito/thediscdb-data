  "Plot": "Faced with the impending dissolution of The French Dispatch, a factual weekly report on various subjects, old-school editor-in-chief Arthur Howitzer Jr. assembles the cr\u00E8me de la cr\u00E8me of the magazine\u0027s loyal expatriate journalists for one final issue. Against the backdrop of picturesque Ennui-sur-Blas\u00E9, Paris, France, three main articles unfold, pivoting around tormented genius artists, statuesque prison officers, flamboyant critics, moody idealists, conflicted ace reporters, legendary chefs, and, of course, the police.",
