  "Plot": "Freshly dumped by her musician boyfriend and fired from her job, all on the same day, suddenly, the rudderless thirtysomething, Emily Middleton, finds herself with two non-refundable tickets to Ecuador. Finding hard to swallow that she is about to lose the trip of a lifetime, Emily turns to the only person left to come with her: her idiosyncratic, phobic, and cat-loving mother, Linda. But, there, the dream holiday soon turns into an Equatorial nightmare when the mother-and-daughter duo ends up conned and abducted in broad daylight. Now, to stay alive, scaredy-cat Linda and impulsive Emily will need to set aside their differences, and like a fish out of water, navigate through dense jungle thickets. But, can they make it happen?",
