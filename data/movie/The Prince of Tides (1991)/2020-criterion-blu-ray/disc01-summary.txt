Description: Barbra Streisand improvised her own system in the editing room to multiply her options and speed up the editing process. Since the Avid and its successors hadn't been widely adopted yet, she used her 8 mm video camera on a tripod to film each version of a scene before the editor pulled the actual film apart to try it a different way. Then Streisand could review the video and decide which option she preferred, which the editor could quickly recreate. Presented here are some of the alternate versions of scenes she filmed.

Description: A version of the closing credits of The Prince of Tides featuring Barbra Streisand's vocal performance of a song written for the film, "Places That Belong to You," was well received by test audiences and eagerly anticipated by Columbia Pictures for promotion, soundtrack album sales, and the possibility of an Academy Award nomination for best song. But Streisand felt that this was Tom Wingo's story, and that the last thing the audience should hear was Nick Nolte's voice-over...not Susan Lowenstein suddently singing a song. Here is that alternate version.

The following excerpt records the audience reaaction that led her to inser three feet of film into th already cut-negative.
