  "Plot": "The Mayo Clinic: Faith - Hope - Science tells the story of a unique medical institution that has been called a \u0022Medical Mecca,\u0022 the \u0022Supreme Court of Medicine,\u0022 and the \u0022place for hope where there is no hope.\u0022 The Mayo Clinic began in 1883 as an unlikely partnership between the Sisters of Saint Francis and a country doctor named William Worrall Mayo after a devastating tornado in rural Minnesota. Since then, it has grown into an organization that treats more than a million patients a year from all 50 states and 150 countries. Dr. Mayo had a simple philosophy he imparted to his sons Will and Charlie: \u0022the needs of the patient come first.\u0022 They wouldn\u0027t treat diseases...they would treat people. In a world where healthcare delivery is typically fragmented among individual specialties, the Mayo Clinic practices a multi-specialty, team-based approach that has, from its beginnings, created a culture that thrives on collaboration.",
