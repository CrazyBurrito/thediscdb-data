Under his near-obsessive guidance, young ballerina Victoria Page is poised for superstardom, but earns Lermontov\u0027s scorn when she falls in love with Julian Craster, composer of \u0022The Red Shoes,\u0022 the ballet Lermontov is staging to showcase her talents. Vicky leaves the company and marries Craster, but still finds herself torn between Lermontov\u0027s demands and those of her heart.",
